# Meta-Agent Post-MA-DR-09 Handoff Package

## 1. Handoff purpose

Transfer the Meta-Agent product-build route from the oversized source conversation to a fresh dedicated Pro/frontier-capable conversation after the post-merge finalization PR containing this status update is merged and independently verified.

This handoff is navigation, not target truth, activation, implementation, pilot authorization, or repository-write authority.

## 2. Truth and process boundary

Meta-Agent sole target truth:

```text
target-projects/meta-agent/current/approved-spec.md
```

Temporary Mnemosyne process/safety source while physically co-located:

```text
current/human-approved-spec.md
```

The latter may constrain process and repository safety only. It is not Meta-Agent target truth and does not import the Mnemosyne maintenance route.

The receiving conversation must also read:

```text
target-projects/meta-agent/current/meta-agent-mnemosyne-guidance-compatibility-guard.md
```

## 3. Completed milestones

- original Meta-Agent concept reconstructed and clarified;
- DR-01–05 completed, preserved and synthesized;
- v0.1 requirements, authority and initial methodology bootstrap completed;
- Owner disposition `ACCEPT_WITH_LIMITATIONS` recorded;
- MA-DR-06/07 completed and adjudicated;
- MA-DR-08 and MA-DR-10–15 completed, preserved and adjudicated;
- MA-DR-11 short-runtime enhanced review completed; no rerun required;
- MA-DR-09 completed;
- MA-DR-09 formal intake completed;
- MA-DR-09 target binding completed by a separate reviewer addendum without rewriting its original input limitation;
- PR #248 scope mismatch recorded;
- PR #249 merged the repair files, canonical transport, handoff and compatibility guard;
- post-merge finalization makes current navigation and task records consistent;
- no research report automatically changed target truth or methodology;
- no offline prototype, benchmark, pilot, private-data route or operational activation has been authorized.

## 4. Current phase

```yaml
route: META_AGENT_PRODUCT_BUILD
phase: post_research_candidate_specification_and_offline_prototype_selection
owner_acceptance: ACCEPT_WITH_LIMITATIONS
target_truth_effective_for_operational_use: false
operational_use_authorized: false
pilot_authorized: false
private_material_authorized: false
real_cases: 0
accepted_new_methods_from_research: 0
```

## 5. MA-DR-09 disposition and preservation

```yaml
original_run_disposition: ACCEPT_EXTERNAL_LANDSCAPE_TARGET_MAPPING_BLOCKED
reviewer_binding_addendum: completed
final_combined_disposition: ACCEPT_WITH_CORRECTIONS_AS_NON_EXECUTION_SOURCE_EVIDENCE
clean_rerun_required: false
canonical_transport:
  parts: 37
  original_bytes: 88451

  pre_merge_remote_component_verification: PASS_37_OF_37
  merge_tree_identity_preserved: true
```

Candidate counts, sample sizes, threshold values, time estimates, baseline applicability and Tier manifests remain calibration/Owner-decision items.

## 7. Pending work ledger

### P0
- select one minimum public/synthetic offline prototype scope;
- produce an exact candidate specification;
- define deterministic acceptance checks;
- decide whether preparing a Tier-0 Owner decision package is worthwhile.

### P1
- review candidate method bundles without automatic promotion;
- define a minimum active-route capability-claim registry;
- define proportional-assurance profiles and review-burden limits;
- reconcile the separately owned non-FABLE health-review dependency.

### Deferred or prohibited
- Tier-1 or Tier-2;
- private material;
- real repository/external-system write pilot;
- automatic methodology promotion;
- operational activation.

## 8. Receive-only first round

The new conversation's first substantive response must only:
- verify the finalization PR merge and latest `master`;
- read this handoff and required target-local files;
- return `handoff_receive_report`;
- report missing, stale or conflicting artifacts;
- stop without Owner decisions, implementation, pilot planning/execution, private-material ingestion or repository writes.

After the receive report, the user separately sends the augmented Mnemosyne guidance command from the compatibility guard.
