# Repository Recording Plan and Preflight

## 1. Authorization basis

The user instructed the dedicated Meta-Agent conversation to continue after PR #241 merged and to advance the current mainline autonomously. The previously visible plan identified this exact Batch-A repository-recording task, branch, target-local paths, navigation updates, and non-authoritative result records.

This plan records execution; it does not create authority independently.

## 2. Pre-branch state

```yaml
PR_241:
  merged: true
  merge_commit: f690209dfc71e6d235f398589eb7b1aa52b0df71
  Meta_Agent_target_modified: false

master_at_preflight: f690209dfc71e6d235f398589eb7b1aa52b0df71
master_identical_to_PR_241_merge_commit: true
accessible_open_PRs: []
exact_task_ID_repository_matches: []
intended_branch_matches: []
decision: create_new_canonical_lineage
```

## 3. Canonical lineage

```yaml
task_id: META-AGENT-RESEARCH-BATCH-A-ADJUDICATION-001
base_branch: master
pinned_base_sha: f690209dfc71e6d235f398589eb7b1aa52b0df71
canonical_branch: meta-agent-research-batch-a-adjudication-001
canonical_PR: PENDING
scope_summary: preserve_and_adjudicate_MA_DR_06_07_prepare_DR_08_defer_DR_09_and_sync_navigation
parallel_variants_approved: false
```

## 4. Exact allowed path classes

```text
target-projects/meta-agent/research/batches/2026Q3-batch-a/
target-projects/meta-agent/research/README.md
target-projects/meta-agent/current/active-context.md

```

## 5. Prohibited changes

- `target-projects/meta-agent/current/approved-spec.md`;
- `target-projects/meta-agent/methodology/core-methodology.md`;
- `target-projects/meta-agent/authority/source-and-owner-map.md`;
- `target-projects/meta-agent/cases/case-and-feedback-ledger.md`;
- target version/decision records except the separately authorized navigation records listed above;
- `current/human-approved-spec.md`;
- Mnemosyne maintenance live-route files;
- other target projects;
- operational activation, pilot execution, private-material ingestion, method promotion, MA-DR-08 execution, or MA-DR-09 runnable-task generation.

## 6. Verification gates

Before a merge instruction:

1. all batch paths exist remotely;
2. exact report bytes match their local SHA-256 identities;
3. manifest paths and hashes match the remote branch;
4. changed paths remain within the allowlist;
5. latest `master` and all accessible open PRs are rechecked;
6. a real canonical PR is created;
7. PR metadata and full changed-file inventory are independently re-read;
8. task result and finalization records are committed and re-read;
9. no CI-pass claim is made without evidence;
10. MA-DR-08 remains `READY_NOT_SELECTED`.
