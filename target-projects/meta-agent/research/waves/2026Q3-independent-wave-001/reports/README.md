# Independent Research Wave Reports

This directory preserves exact operator-exported report bytes for MA-DR-08, MA-DR-10 through MA-DR-15, including MA-DR-09.

## MA-DR-08 and MA-DR-10–15

Use the pre-existing `report-parts-manifest.yaml` entries and `identities/*.yaml`. PR #247 verified 56 transport components and reconstruction for seven reports.

## MA-DR-09 canonical transport

```text
MA-DR-09 exact UTF-8 bytes
-> bzip2 level 9
-> Base64
-> reports/MA-DR-09-report-bz2-base64/part-001.txt ... part-037.txt
```

Read `identities/MA-DR-09.yaml` for order and hashes and `identities/MA-DR-09-post-merge-verification.yaml` for the merge/readback status.

The merged PR #248 path `MA-DR-09-report-parts-base64/` was incomplete and noncanonical and was removed by PR #249.

## Authority boundary

Reports are external non-execution evidence. They do not change target truth, methodology, permissions, pilot status, private-material status, or operational activation.
